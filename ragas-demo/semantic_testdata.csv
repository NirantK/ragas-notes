2,"What impact does interacting with an unreliable large-language-model dialog assistant have on human performance in tasks, given the presence of societal biases in the model?","- On these tasks, we find that human participants who interact with an unreliable large-language-model dialog assistant through chat -- a trivial baseline strategy for scalable oversight -- substantially outperform both the model alone and their own unaided performance.
- These results are an encouraging sign that scalable oversight will be tractable to study with present models and bolster recent findings that large language models can productively assist humans with difficult tasks.
- It has been observed that large-scale language models capture undesirable societal biases, e.g. relating to race and gender; yet religious bias has been relatively unexplored.
- We demonstrate that GPT-3, a state-of-the-art contextual language model, captures persistent Muslim-violence bias.
- We probe GPT-3 in various ways, including prompt completion, analogical reasoning, and story generation, to understand this anti-Muslim bias, demonstrating that it appears consistently and creatively in different uses of the model and that it is severe even compared to biases about other religious groups.
- For instance, Muslim is analogized to terrorist in 23% of test cases, while Jewish is mapped to its most common stereotype, money, in 5% of test cases.
- We quantify the positive distraction needed to overcome this bias with adversarial text prompts, and find that use of the most positive 6 adjectives reduces violent completions for Muslims from 66% to 20%, but which is still higher than for other religious groups.","Interacting with an unreliable large-language-model dialog assistant has a positive impact on human performance in tasks, as human participants who interact with the assistant outperform both the model alone and their own unaided performance.

- We set out to investigate whether GPT-3.5 (Codex and InstructGPT) can be applied to answer and reason about difficult real-world-based questions.
- We utilize two multiple-choice medical exam questions (USMLE and MedMCQA) and a medical reading comprehension dataset (PubMedQA).
- We investigate multiple prompting scenarios: Chain-of-Thought (CoT, think step-by-step), zero- and few-shot (prepending the question with question-answer exemplars) and retrieval augmentation (injecting Wikipedia passages into the prompt).
- For a subset of the USMLE questions, a medical expert reviewed and annotated the model's CoT.
- We found that InstructGPT can often read, reason and recall expert knowledge.
- Failure are primarily due to lack of knowledge and reasoning errors and trivial guessing heuristics are observed, e.g.\ too often predicting labels A and D on USMLE.

9,How does the ability of a language model to associate answer options with symbols impact its performance in multiple choice question answering tasks?,"- A more natural prompting approach is to present the question and answer options to the LLM jointly and have it output the symbol (e.g.,""A"") associated with its chosen answer option.
- This approach allows the model to explicitly compare answer options, reduces computational costs, and mitigates the effects of tokenization scheme and answer option representations on answer selection.
- For the natural approach to be effective, the LLM it is used with must be able to associate answer options with the symbols that represent them.
